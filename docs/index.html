            The Integer Book is a collection of sheet music visualisations that uses numbers instead of letters to refer to notes and chords. Read more below. 
    
            <h3 class="unnumbered" id="the-philosophy">the philosophy</h3>
            <p> <i>“Understand the music you hear, play the music you imagine”</i></p>
            <p>
                The above slogan<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> summarises succinctly my personal
                goal in my musical journey. In order to accomplish this goal, we need an
                easy way to translate the feeling that music generates when we hear or
                imagine it, to theoretical symbols we can use to understand and play the
                music.
            </p>

            <p>
                The problem with conventional symbols like F# or C is that they don't
                correspond to one particular feeling, since an F# will generate a very
                different feeling in a melody in D major (happy / uplifting) compared to
                a melody in G major (tension). However, an F# in G major does generate a
                very similar feeling to a B in C major. This is because they are both
                the 7th of their respective scales. This holds true for any relative
                position in the scale: e.g. E in A major and G# in C# major (both the
                5th) or Eb in C major and Bb in G major (both the b3th).
            </p>

            <p>
                Therefore, if we think about and write down melodies in terms of their
                relative position in the scale, it gets very easy to translate the
                feeling the music generates to their corresponding theoretical symbol (a
                number). And together with the key of the song, this also gives us all
                the information we need to find the right note on our instrument.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="unnumbered" id="the-method">the method</h3>
            <p>The songs in this book are represented using numbers. Each number
            refers to a location within the major scale. For example, if the song is
            in D major, the 3 would refer to the F#. The numbers in the melody refer
            to single tones. The numbers of the chords refer to the chord
            corresponding to the tone. Again, in D major, the 6- chord would be
            B-D-F#.</p>
            
            <h3 class="unnumbered" id="the-name">the name</h3>
            <p>A Real Book is a compilation of lead sheets for jazz standards. The
            name is derived from "fake books", so called because they contained only
            rough outlines of music pieces rather than fully notated scores.<a
            href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
            role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In mathematics the real numbers are
            a collection containing all numbers with a possibly infinite decimal
            expansion. A subset of these are the integer numbers, which can be
            written without the use of decimals. Since these are the only numbers we
            use to represent the music in this book, it is called The Integer
            Book.</p>
